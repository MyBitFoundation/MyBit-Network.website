# network.js library
A node.js library for interacting with the MyBit Network SDK.

## Setup

Install dependencies.

`npm install`

## Start blockchain

We have included a local blockchain with our contracts already deployed. Our API creates instances of our contracts deployed on the local chain and exposes them for easy interaction. To start the chain simply open up a terminal in the base directory and enter the following command:

`./start_chain`

## Running scripts

We have provided a hello world example of a successful crowdsale to buy coffees. Open a new terminal in the base directory and type the following:

`node example.js`

### ⚠️ Warning
This application is unstable and has not undergone any rigorous security audits. Use at your own risk.
